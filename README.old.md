# 🌱 Mentorship Tracker

> A gift for my mentor Davis, who showed me that great mentorship deserves great tools.

## 🎯 The Problem

After participating in Microsoft and AWS mentorship programs, I noticed they run "blind" - no visibility into whether mentees are progressing or stuck. My mentor Davis built AWS's program but had no way to track effectiveness.

## 💡 The Solution

A lightweight tracker that gives mentors and coordinators visibility without adding admin burden:
- **For Mentees:** Clear goals, session prep, progress tracking
- **For Mentors:** Overview of all mentees, engagement signals
- **For Coordinators:** Program health dashboard, export data

## 🛠️ Built With

- React + Next.js
